# What is Software Engineering?

Software Engineering is the <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">systematic application</span> of <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">engineering principles</span> to the <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">design</span>, <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">development</span>, <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">maintenance</span>, <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">testing</span>, and <span v-mark.underline.yellow="">evaluation of software</span>.

It involves a <span v-mark.underline.red="">disciplined approach</span> to <span v-mark.underline.red="">analyzing user needs</span>, <span v-mark.underline.red="">planning and managing projects</span>, creating software systems, and <span v-mark.underline.red="">ensuring their reliability</span>, <span v-mark.underline.red="">efficiency</span>, and <span v-mark.underline.red="">maintainability</span>.

You will need a blend of <span v-mark.underline.green="">technical Skills</span>, <span v-mark.underline.green="">engineering methods</span> and <span v-mark.underline.green="">project management</span> to produce <span v-mark.circle.white="">high-quality software systems</span>.

# Algorithms and FlowCharts

Definition: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It is a sequence of instructions that are followed to achieve a desired outcome.

Example: An algorithm for making a cup of tea might include steps like boiling water, adding a tea bag to a cup, pouring the hot water into the cup, letting it steep for a few minutes, and then removing the tea bag.

---

# flowchart

Definition: A flowchart is a visual representation of the steps in a process or system using symbols, arrows, and text. It depicts the sequence of operations or steps, making it easier to understand how a process flows from start to finish.

Example: A flowchart for logging into a website might start with a "Start" symbol, followed by a decision symbol asking if the user has entered their username and password, arrows leading to "Enter username" and "Enter password" steps, and an end symbol once the login process is successful.
